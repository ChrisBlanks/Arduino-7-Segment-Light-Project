# Arduino-7-Segment-Light-Project
This C++ code was made to control the output of an improvised 7-segment LED (7 LEDs arranged in the shape of an 8). It requires seven LEDs, ten 470 Ohm resistors (to promote proper current flow and protect circuit components), three button switches, a breadboard, an Arduino Uno, and a bundle of wires. The digital pins of the Arduino Uno were mainly used. The 5 Volt supply and ground (GND) pin were used for the buttons. Of course, the short end (cathode) of the LEDs will also need to be connected to ground. This code was influenced by the Button example code in the Arduino Library.
